    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
      My name is <strong>James Van Hook</strong>, I am a 29 year old marine that
      retired in 2014. I graduated from the
      <i>University of Southern Mississippi</i> with a
      <b>bachelors degree</b> in Marine Biology. I decided that after a few
      years of working offshore that I want to be home more and I have worked a
      little with coding before and have always had an interest in it. I
      recently got the opportunity to be able to return to school and decided
      that I wanted to do a coding bootcamp instead of commiting another 4 years
      for another bachelors degree. I plan on starting a career as a
      <ins>software engineer</ins> after graduating from this coarse.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <p>
        I have many hobbies that I enjoy doing whenever I have free time. The primary hobby that I have is that I am a scuba diver. I have been scuba diving since I was 9 years old and have been certified since I was 11 years old. I also love to swim. I have been swimming since I was a child and before my parents let me scuba dive I had to learn how to swim extremely well. Not only my parents but the teachers I had that certified me made sure that I was able to swim on my own in case something happened when I was out in the water.
